## Tasks
1. Create a class library
2. Implement a BinarySearch generic method.
3. Implement a method that returns IEnumerable<int> of the Fibonacci's numbers using the iterator block yield.
4. Develop a generic class-collection Queue/Stack that implements basic operations. Implement the capability to iterate by collection by design pattern Iterator.
5. Creata a console application which demonstrates the fucntionality of the class library.
6. Create another console application.
7. Implement a calculator which evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation. For example, expression 5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 - (which is equivalent to 5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3 in normal notation) should evaluate to 14. Note, that for simplicity you may assume that there are always spaces between numbers and operations, e.g. 1 3 + expression is valid, but 1 3+ isn't. Empty expression should evaluate to 0. Valid operations are +, -, *, /.
