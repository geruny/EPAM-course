## Tasks  
**Objective:** 
1) Create a class library (ArrayHelper) 
2) In that library implement a class, which allows to bubble-sort an array (both ASC/DESC) (add necessary validations)
3) In that library implement a class, which allows to calculate the sum of all positive elements in a two dimensional array (add necessary validations)
4) Create another class library (RectangleHelper)
5) In that library implement a class, which allows to calculate perimeter and square of a rectangle (add necessary validations)
6) Create a console application, which demonstrates the functional of these two libraries
7) Create a multi-file assembly from these two libraries (ArrayHelper and RectangleHelper)
8) Assign the resulting assembly to the strong name
9) Place the resulting assembly in GAC
10) Update your code to run the console application without ArrayHelper and RectangleHelperin the folder (use your new multi-file assembly from GAC)
11) Use ILDASM to analyze the contents of assemblies
